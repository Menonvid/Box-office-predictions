Microsoft is planning to venture into Movie Business. 
We decided to explore the data give to us and analyse the following
Q1- How was the movie industry doing in the last decade from 2009-2019?
2- What is the  best production budget range for profitable movies?
3- What are the most successful genres?
4- What is the best season for each genere?
5- Does the runtime has any effect on  the success of the genre?

The data scientist conducted a comprehensive analysis of the movies data and set a couple of recommendations of what types of movies could be profitable at the box office. The data scientists set the findings based in many factors such as the type of genre the season, the production budget,  length of the movie. The data scientist ends up with  informative visa;ized recommendations to the executive director of microsoft.
